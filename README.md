# Ride-Sharing-System
The Ride Sharing Platform is a simple program that simulates a ride-sharing service, allowing users to register as drivers or riders, offer or request rides, and interact with the system. The program uses object-oriented principles with interfaces and classes to model users, rides, and the ride-sharing platform.
